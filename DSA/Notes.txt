Linear data structure
- Arrays, Linkieed lists, stacks, queyes.

Non-linear DS - element connected to n number of elements in the
- Trees, Graphs


static ds - memory allocated at compile time

dynamic ds - memory allocated at run time

Common operations - 
Searching, Sorting Insertion , Updation, Deletion

Stack is an ADT -> which uses either Arrays or Linked lists for implementation

An ADT tells what is to be done and data structure tells how it is to be done.

---------------
Arrays -> kunal kushawaha
heap
- heap is a region of comp memory used for dynamic memory allocation 
- It's a large pool of memory where objects are dynamically stored during program execution - Objects created with new keyword are always stored in heap memory.
- Objects remain in heap memory until they are no longer referenced - and then garbage collected

- declaration of referece variables etc -> at compile time
- intialization of obbjects happens at run time

dynamic memory allocation -> at the time of runtime memory allocation happens
